A Vowel Checker is a simple tool or program that allows users to analyze a given string (typically a word or name) and identify the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) within it. It provides information about the occurrence of each vowel and how many vowels are present in total. It is a useful tool for string manipulation tasks.
